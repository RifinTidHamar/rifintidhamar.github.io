Are you curious how to turn simple shapes into complex scenes? This might answer that for you!

We will be breaking down the process of the forest in this video.

Intro: Making a tree
----
Look at this amazing thing. Two triangles. Beautiful. \
<img src="\images\generated-tree\twotriangles.png">

but what's this? Now there is a rhombus. Indeed quite beautiful... but where did the two triangles go? \
<img src="\images\generated-tree\rhombus.png">

It's too bad really... wait... unless. Maybe I have it all wrong.

Yes, now that I think about it. The rhombus is the two triangles, but come together as one! Simply amazing. Nature's wonder is non-ceasing. 
\
\
ah... Exquisite...
\
\
\
\
But now wait. What's this. Another rhombus? \
<img src="\images\generated-tree\twoRhombuses.png">

Indeed I thought one rhombus was good. Two rhombuses is just... It's beautiful. That's all I really mean to say. Beautiful. 
\
\
My eyes surely decieve me! For it appears the rhombuses have joined just as the triangles previous! It is a shape, that indeed I cannot name, and yet... I don't need to. Its beauty excells a name! \

And now wait what is this? Indeed another beautful shape stacked upon the other. A line! Yes a line! Not too bent nor too straight. Indeed not too bent nor too straight! \
<img src="\images\generated-tree\line.png">

Of all things, I coudln't have imagined this. No I couldn't have imagined anything near its standard! A perfectly varied brown line! \

A good day say I! a good day! Ah, and though it is over, I feel no sadness. For it was magnificent. 
\
\
\
\
But have I spoken too soon? Is more even possible? For now I see a green line. \
*tree with green line* 

And yet again, less I am mad! But no! Two more green lines! \
*tree with three green lines*

I fear this may be too much for me. Can my eyes handle this, neigh, my soul? For the lines ever increase! \
*tree with more lines* \
*tree with more lines* 

Though I was in darkness, now I see. It was mere shapes to me, and that would have been enough. But now, as though I have been struck, it is a tree before me. Yes, I was blind. \
*tree* 

Grass

So uh... that was a little weird. Just trying to make it interesting you know?
