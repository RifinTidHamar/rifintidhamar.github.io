Abstract—Machine learning (ML) methods achieved remarkable success recently. However, the trust by domain
experts for many new black-box models is quite low. Visualization is a natural way to involve domain experts to the process of
development of explainable models, which can mitigate the deficiencies of black-box models. It is typically easier for humans to understand and reason within visualizations of data and models. Recent Sequential Rule Generation (SRG) algorithms for categorical qualitative data, and a lossless visualization system in 3-D based on the Shifted Paired Coordinates (SPC-3D) allow producing ML models as (1) interpretable approximators of black-boxes or as (2) independent interpretable models with
accuracy comparable with black boxes on the same data. However, SRG can generate a large set of rules that are difficult to analyze and visualize. This paper proposes a new algorithm to Join and Modify Rules (JMR), which creates a smaller set of rules with the same precision and coverage for a given set of rules. It is explored in the case studies, which show its efficiency along with SPC-3D visualization system for getting trustable models.
