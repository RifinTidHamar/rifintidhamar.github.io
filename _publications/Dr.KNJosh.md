Interpretable interactive visual pattern discovery in lossless 3D visualization is a promising way to advance machine learning. It enables end users who are not data scientists to take control of the model development process as a self-service. It is conducted in 3D General Line Coordinates (GLC) visualization space, which preserves all n-D information in 3D. This paper presents a system which combines three types of GLC: Shifted Paired Coordinates (SPC), Shifted Tripled Coordinates (STC), and General Line Coordinates-Linear (GLC-L) for interactive visual pattern discovery. A transition from 2-D visualization to 3-D visualization allows for a more distinct visual pattern than in 2-D and it also allows for finding the best data viewing positions, which are not available in 2-D. It enables in-depth visual analysis of various class-specific data subsets comprehensible for end users in the original interpretable attributes. Controlling model overgeneralization by end users is an additional benefit of this approach.
