Main Reel
------
A glimpse of my work. Includes Procedural Models and Textures, a Custom lighting model, and various interactive raymarched simulations.

Deeper Dives into Tools
------
***Per Texel Lighting*** -- This is a custom lighting-model which lights per texel (using an object's UVs). Its purpose is mainly artistic, but future plans include raytraced lighting optimized even for mobile devices.

\
\
***GLC-3D*** -- A look into the program that I made as a research assistant at CWU. Its purpose is to allow data scientists to explore data visually. 
{% include youtube.html id="JrPOSkUqRmU" %}
\
\
***Boid-Crowd*** -- Its purpose is to be used as a tool for placing easy-to-run crowds.

Individual Shorts
------
***Blue Cave*** -- A fully procedural cave using my per-texel lighting. 
{% include youtube.html id="Ws-bU89hedo" %}
\
\
***Flimsy Generated Paper*** -- using custom GPU physics.
{% include youtube.html id="fGGO5vmnz3U" %}
\
\
***Liquid Physics Fog*** -- Uses outsourced liquid physics which interacts with a phone's gyroscope. The particles are then raymarched and culled based off a depth-texture. 
{% include youtube.html id="8rGydXCDR8U" %}
\
\
***Ancient Scribbles*** -- Uses my per texel lighting and a hand drawn normal map. 
{% include youtube.html id="rJL6GDrG5hI" %}
\
\
***Interactable 3D smoke*** -- Custom raymarched smoke physics that can be interacted with on smartphone. 
{% include youtube.html id="r1WmCaGGPiY" %}
\
\
***Procedural Trees*** -- A fully procedural forest. [Breakdown](/posts/2026/01/generated-forest/)
{% include youtube.html id="y8nq1nw3OyY" %}
\
\
***Interactable Mud Texture*** -- GPU particles interactable on mobile. 
{% include youtube.html id="7ZpkKpn6ZTo" %}

Walkthoughs and Commentary on my Games
------
***Card Game*** -- A game I made with my college group.
{% include youtube.html id="YOxOCwjYIwA" %}
\
\
***820*** -- A little prototype about a beam of light traveling to earth
{% include youtube.html id="xBZlcRnPtss" %}
\
\
***Alpha walkthrough*** -- The first third of my game, Night Walk.
